### âš¡ **Performance Optimization**
- **Parallel Model Inference**: Multiple AI models can run simultaneously
- **Dependency Resolution**: Smart pipeline execution based on agent dependencies
- **Resource Management**: Optimal CPU and memory utilization
- **Throughput Optimization**: Increased requests per second

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent Pipeline Management**
- **Dynamic Pipeline Selection**: Routes requests to optimal agent combinations
- **Parallel vs Sequential Execution**: Automatically determines execution strategy
- **Memory Integration**: Parallel memory retrieval with context building
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling with fallback strategies

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### AsyncOrchestrator
The main orchestrator that manages parallel execution:

```python
class AsyncOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, max_workers: int = 4):
        # Initialize with configurable worker pool
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers)
        self.agents = {...}  # All AI agents
        self.performance_metrics = {...}  # Performance tracking
```

#### Execution Pipeline
Smart pipeline execution with parallel capabilities:

```python
async def _execute_pipeline_parallel(self, prompt: str, pipeline: List[str], category: str):
    # Determine which agents can run in parallel
    # Execute independent agents simultaneously
    # Handle dependencies sequentially
    # Gather results and build context
```

#### Performance Tracking
Comprehensive performance monitoring:

```python
performance_metrics = {
    "parallel_execution_count": 0,
    "concurrent_agents": 0,
    "throughput": 0.0
}

execution_stats = {
    "total_tasks": 0,
    "completed_tasks": 0,
    "failed_tasks": 0,
    "average_execution_time": 0.0
}
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from core.async_orchestrator import AsyncOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator(max_workers=4)

# Handle request asynchronously
result = await orchestrator.handle("What is artificial intelligence?")

# Get performance stats
stats = await orchestrator.get_performance_stats()
```

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Start interactive async orchestrator
meta-async start --max-workers 4

# Test single prompt
meta-async test --prompt "Explain machine learning" --max-workers 4

# Benchmark with multiple prompts
meta-async benchmark --prompts "What is AI?,How does ML work?,Explain neural networks" --max-workers 4

# Show performance statistics
meta-async performance --max-workers 4
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Custom pipeline execution
pipeline = ["Memory", "Retrieval", "Reasoning"]
results = await orchestrator._execute_pipeline_parallel(prompt, pipeline, category)

# Performance monitoring
stats = await orchestrator.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Throughput: {stats['performance_metrics']['throughput']} ops/second")

# Graceful shutdown
await orchestrator.shutdown()
```

## Performance Benefits

### Parallel Execution
- **Memory + Retrieval**: Can run simultaneously (no dependencies)
- **Metrics + SelfImprovement**: Independent operations
- **NLU + Retrieval**: Parallel intent classification and data retrieval

### Sequential Dependencies
- **Reasoning**: Depends on Retrieval results
- **Planning**: Depends on Reasoning output
- **Context Building**: Sequential memory integration

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Throughput** | Requests per second | > 10 req/s |
| **Latency** | Average response time | < 2 seconds |
| **Concurrent Agents** | Max agents running simultaneously | 3-5 agents |
| **Parallel Execution Rate** | % of operations running in parallel | > 60% |

## Configuration

### Worker Pool Configuration

```python
# High performance (more workers)
orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator(max_workers=8)

# Balanced (default)
orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator(max_workers=4)

# Resource constrained
orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator(max_workers=2)
```

### Agent Parallelization Rules

```python
# Agents that can run in parallel
parallel_agents = [
    "Memory",      # Independent memory retrieval
    "Metrics",     # Performance monitoring
    "SelfImprovement", # Self-reflection
    "Retrieval",   # Data retrieval
    "NLU"          # Intent classification
]

# Agents that must run sequentially
sequential_agents = [
    "Reasoning",   # Depends on Retrieval
    "Planning"     # Depends on Reasoning
]
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Performance Metrics

```python
# Get comprehensive performance stats
stats = await orchestrator.get_performance_stats()

print(f"Total tasks: {stats['execution_stats']['total_tasks']}")
print(f"Completed: {stats['execution_stats']['completed_tasks']}")
print(f"Failed: {stats['execution_stats']['failed_tasks']}")
print(f"Average time: {stats['execution_stats']['average_execution_time']:.2f}s")
print(f"Throughput: {stats['performance_metrics']['throughput']:.2f} ops/s")
print(f"Concurrent agents: {stats['performance_metrics']['concurrent_agents']}")
```

### Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor performance in real-time
meta-async start --max-workers 4

# In interactive mode, type 'stats' to see current performance
You: stats
ðŸ“Š Performance Stats: {
  "execution_stats": {...},
  "performance_metrics": {...}
}
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

```python
# Agent execution errors are handled gracefully
result = await orchestrator._execute_agent_async(agent_name, agent, input_data, category)

if not result["success"]:
    logger.error(f"Agent {agent_name} failed: {result['error']}")
    # Continue with other agents or use fallback
```

### Fallback Strategies

```python
# If parallel execution fails, fall back to sequential
try:
    results = await orchestrator._execute_pipeline_parallel(prompt, pipeline, category)
except Exception as e:
    # Fall back to sequential execution
    results = await orchestrator._execute_pipeline_sequential(prompt, pipeline, category)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Worker Pool Sizing**
- **CPU-bound tasks**: Set workers to CPU cores
- **I/O-bound tasks**: Set workers to 2-4x CPU cores
- **Mixed workloads**: Start with 4 workers, adjust based on performance

### 2. **Pipeline Optimization**
- **Independent agents**: Run in parallel
- **Dependent agents**: Run sequentially
- **Memory integration**: Run early in pipeline

### 3. **Resource Management**
- **Monitor memory usage**: Large models can consume significant RAM
- **CPU utilization**: Balance between parallelism and resource contention
- **Network I/O**: Consider async I/O for external API calls

### 4. **Error Handling**
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue with available agents
- **Retry logic**: Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit breakers**: Prevent cascade failures

## Comparison with Synchronous Orchestrator

| Aspect | Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Execution** | Sequential | Parallel |
| **Throughput** | ~2 req/s | ~10+ req/s |
| **Latency** | 3-5 seconds | 1-2 seconds |
| **Resource Usage** | Low | Moderate |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Moderate |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Advanced |

## Troubleshooting

   ```

2. **Slow Performance**
   ```bash
   # Check performance stats
   meta-async performance
   
   # Increase worker count
   meta-async start --max-workers 8
   ```

3. **Agent Failures**
   ```python
   # Check agent logs
   logger.error(f"Agent {agent_name} failed: {error}")
   
   # Verify agent initialization
   agent._ensure_model()
   ```

### Performance Tuning

```python
# Monitor performance metrics
stats = await orchestrator.get_performance_stats()

# Adjust based on metrics
if stats['performance_metrics']['throughput'] < 5:
    # Increase worker count
    orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator(max_workers=8)

if stats['execution_stats']['average_execution_time'] > 3:
    # Optimize pipeline or reduce complexity
    pipeline = ["Retrieval", "Reasoning"]  # Simplified pipeline
```

python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --step 1
python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --step 2
# ... etc for steps 3-10
```

### 2. Verify Integration

```bash
# Check that new directories were created
ls -la data_collection/
ls -la model_development/
ls -la fine_tuning/
ls -la retrieval/
ls -la orchestration/
ls -la optimization/
ls -la evaluation/
ls -la continuous_improvement/
```

### 3. Review Integration Documents

- `docs/MODEL_DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Complete roadmap
- `docs/MODEL_DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed implementation
- `docs/PILLAR_MODEL_DEVELOPMENT_MAPPING.md` - Pillar integration mapping

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Start with Foundation
```bash
# Run foundation steps (1-3)
for step in 1 2 3; do
    python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --step $step
done
```

### 2. Implement Core Features
```bash
# Run core development steps (4-6)
for step in 4 5 6; do
    python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --step $step
done
```

### 3. Add Advanced Features
```bash
# Run advanced features steps (7-8)
for step in 7 8; do
    python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --step $step
done
```

### 4. Complete Production Readiness
```bash
# Run production readiness steps (9-10)
for step in 9 10; do
    python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --step $step
done
```

## 📊 Testing Your Integration

### 1. Run Basic Tests
```bash
# Test that all new directories exist
python -c "
import os
dirs = ['data_collection', 'model_development', 'fine_tuning', 
        'retrieval', 'orchestration', 'optimization', 
        'evaluation', 'continuous_improvement']
for d in dirs:
    print(f'{d}: {\"✓\" if os.path.exists(d) else \"✗\"}')
"
```

### 2. Test Integration Script
```bash
# Test the integration script
python scripts/integrate_model_development.py --help
```

### 3. Verify File Creation
```bash
# Check that key files were created
ls -la config/model_planning.yml
ls -la core/model_scoping.py
ls -la docs/model_requirements.md
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Integration script fails
**Solution**: Check that you're in the project root directory
```bash
pwd  # Should show your project root
ls -la scripts/integrate_model_development.py  # Should exist
```

#### Issue: Files not created
**Solution**: Check permissions and create manually
```bash
mkdir -p data_collection model_development fine_tuning
touch data_collection/__init__.py
```

#### Issue: Import errors
**Solution**: Check Python path and dependencies
```bash
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
pip install -r config/requirements.txt
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation**: Review the detailed implementation docs
2. **Run Tests**: Use the testing commands above
3. **Manual Creation**: Create files manually if script fails
4. **Review Logs**: Check the integration script logs

## 🎯 Next Steps

### After Integration
1. **Review**: Go through all created files and understand the structure
2. **Customize**: Modify implementations to match your specific needs
3. **Test**: Run your existing tests to ensure nothing broke
4. **Document**: Update your project documentation

### Ongoing Development
1. **Iterate**: Use the continuous improvement step (10) for ongoing updates
2. **Monitor**: Use the evaluation step (9) for performance monitoring
3. **Optimize**: Use the optimization step (8) for performance improvements
4. **Scale**: Use the orchestration step (7) for scaling capabilities

### Advanced Usage
1. **Custom Agents**: Extend the agent system with your own agents
2. **Domain Adaptation**: Use the fine-tuning step (4) for domain-specific models
3. **Safety**: Enhance the safety step (5) with your specific safety requirements
4. **Knowledge**: Extend the knowledge integration step (6) with your knowledge sources

This quick start guide provides everything you need to begin implementing the 10-step model development process into your Quark project. The integration is designed to be systematic, comprehensive, and maintainable.

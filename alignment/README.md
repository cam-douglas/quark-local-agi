print(f"Safe: {result.is_safe}")
print(f"Categories: {[cat.value for cat in result.categories]}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.2f}")
```

### Ethical Assessment
```python
from alignment.ethical_practices import EthicalPractices

ethics = EthicalPractices()
assessments = ethics.assess_ethical_compliance("I will help you solve this problem.")

for assessment in assessments:
    print(f"{assessment.principle.value}: {assessment.score:.2f}")
```

### Alignment Measurement
```python
from alignment.alignment_monitor import AlignmentMonitor

monitor = AlignmentMonitor()
report = monitor.measure_alignment({
    'request': "How can I help?",
    'response': "I can assist you with various tasks."
})

print(f"Alignment Score: {report.overall_score:.2f}")
print(f"Status: {report.overall_status.value}")
```

### RLHF Feedback
```python
from alignment.rlhf_agent import RLHFAgent

rlhf = RLHFAgent()
result = rlhf.collect_feedback(
    prompt="What is the capital of France?",
    response="The capital of France is Paris.",
    feedback_type="rating",
    rating=5
)
```

### Adversarial Testing
```python
from alignment.adversarial_testing import AdversarialTesting

testing = AdversarialTesting()
result = testing.run_test_suite(
    test_categories=["prompt_injection"],
    custom_prompts=[]
)

print(f"Tests run: {result['tests_run']}")
print(f"Vulnerabilities: {result['vulnerabilities_found']}")
```

### Comprehensive Safety Assessment
```python
from agents.safety_agent import SafetyAgent

safety_agent = SafetyAgent()
result = safety_agent.generate("I will help you write code.", operation="assess_safety")

print(f"Safe: {result['assessment']['is_safe']}")

- **Graph Management**: Add, update, and query entities and relationships
- **Semantic Search**: Find entities using natural language queries

### Advanced Reasoning
- **Path Finding**: Discover connections between entities
- **Similarity Analysis**: Find similar entities based on attributes and embeddings
- **Community Detection**: Identify clusters of related entities
- **Centrality Analysis**: Find the most important entities in the graph
- **Relationship Inference**: Suggest potential relationships between entities

### Long-Term Memory
- **Persistent Storage**: JSON-based memory persistence
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Find memories using semantic similarity
- **Memory Consolidation**: Merge similar memories to reduce redundancy
- **Importance Tracking**: Prioritize memories based on importance and access patterns

### Cross-Document Reasoning

- **Fact Extraction**: Extract and store facts from documents
- **Cross-Reference Queries**: Query knowledge across document boundaries
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Analyze temporal relationships between events

## üìä Usage Examples

### Basic Document Processing
```python
from agents.knowledge_graph_agent import KnowledgeGraphAgent

agent = KnowledgeGraphAgent()

# Process a document
result = agent.generate(
    "Apple Inc. is a technology company. Tim Cook is the CEO.",
    operation='process_document',
    document_id='apple_info'
)
```

### Entity Extraction
```python
# Extract entities from text
entities = agent.generate(
    "Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998.",
    operation='extract_entities'
)
```

### Knowledge Querying
```python
# Query the knowledge graph
results = agent.generate(
    "Apple CEO",
    operation='query_knowledge'
)
```

### Advanced Reasoning
```python
# Find connections between entities
connections = agent.generate(
    "",
    operation='reason',
    reasoning_type='connections',
    entities=['Apple', 'Tim Cook']
)
```

### Memory Operations
```python
# Store memory
memory_id = agent.generate(
    "Tesla produces electric vehicles",
    operation='store_memory',
    memory_type='company_info',
    importance=0.8
)

# Retrieve memories
memories = agent.generate(
    "electric vehicles",
    operation='retrieve_memory'
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è CLI Interface

The knowledge graph functionality is accessible via CLI:

```bash
# Process a document
python cli/knowledge_graph_cli.py process_document --input "Apple is a technology company"

# Extract entities
python cli/knowledge_graph_cli.py extract_entities --input "Google was founded by Larry Page"

# Query knowledge
python cli/knowledge_graph_cli.py query_knowledge --input "Apple CEO"

# Get statistics
python cli/knowledge_graph_cli.py get_statistics
```
